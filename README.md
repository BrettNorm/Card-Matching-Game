# SwiftCardMatchingGame

Card Matching Game

Project Requirements:

 - There are three screens: Main Menu, Settings, and Game.
Main menu has a “Start Game” button that you may design however you wish
The board layout selection MUST be contained on the Settings Screen meaning the Main Menu should not have 3 start buttons but rather one that will use the setting selected by the user


 - The user can tap the back of a card, it will animate a flip, and reveal the front of the card.
 
 - A user can tap on a second card, if it matches, the cards remain revealed, if the cards do not match, they animate a flip back over. Once all cards are revealed, the user is presented with a message that they have won, and given the option to play again.
 
 - The app's options menu/screen will allow the user select how many cards are visible on the screen, with the default being a 4 x 4 scaling up to a 6x6 and scaling down to a 2 x 2.
