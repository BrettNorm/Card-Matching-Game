# SwiftCardMatchingGame

Build a Card Match Game.

Project Requirements:

There will be three screens: Main Menu, Settings, and Game.
Main menu will have a “Start Game” button that you may design however you wish
The board layout selection MUST be contained on the Settings Screen meaning the Main Menu should not have 3 start buttons but rather one that will use the setting selected by the user

Cards MUST fit evenly on the screen.

The user should be able to tap the back of a card, it should animate a flip, and reveal the front of the card.
 
A user will be able to tap on a second card, if it matches, the cards remain revealed, if the cards do not match, they should animate a flip back over. Once all cards are revealed, the user should be presented with a message that they have won, and given the option to play again.
 
A card must have a back and a front.
 
You may create your own graphics for the cards to be matched. Since the max numbers of cards on the screen is 36 (6 x 6), you will have at least 18 cards.
There should be a visible difference from the front and back; the back cannot be the same color as the background of the view it is contained in
 
Either created with images or programmatically (Shapes and GeometryReader for example). Suggestion: Play around with the Emoij font to create the graphics on your cards, if you wish (this is usually the easiest way).
 
Your apps options menu/screen will allow the user select how many cards are visible on the screen, with the default being a 4 x 4 scaling up to a 6x6 and scaling down to a 2 x 2.
